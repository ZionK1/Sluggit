# Sluggit
Social Interactions Made Easy

## What is Sluggit?
Sluggit is a web application that allows UCSC students to find events on campus easily. Our app contains three main categories: housing, official on-campus organizations, and causual social events. These groups can create posts for their specific categories containing information about their event or listing.
