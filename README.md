# Sluggit

## What is Sluggit?
Sluggit is a web application that allows UCSC students to find events on campus easily. Our app contains three main categories: housing, official on-campus organizations, and causual social events. These groups can create posts for their specific categories containing information about their event or listing. 

## Who is the target audience?
Anyone can use Sluggit, but the application is more geared towards UCSC students looking to find a community of lasting friends, as well as housing for the duration of their time in Santa Cruz.
